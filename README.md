# Binary Tree
Implementation of a binary tree in c and its different operations and algorithms.
This is part of the data structrures seminar (TU Freiberg). For more informations and details about the different functions check my paper about [binary trees](https://www.docdroid.net/VpWyh41/binary-trees-pdf).

## Build the project with CMake
Run the following commands from the `Binary-tree` directory :
- `mkdir build`
- `cd build`
- `cmake ..`
- `make`
- `./binary_tree`
